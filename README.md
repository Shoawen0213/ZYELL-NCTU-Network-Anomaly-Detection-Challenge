## ------[File descibe]------- 

### [Preprocessed code]：
	contain three python files, for some featrues processing and data processing.

### [Testing code]： 
		Contain eight folders, version 2 obtain better scrore.
	        Each folders contains two python files for loading testing datasets and fitting to get predictions.
		Models used here are contain in Training model.rar, see detailed info below

### [Training code]：
		 Contain six python files.
		 s1_training_model_flow.py is for training model flow (model algorithm can choose: Random Forest, XGBoost)
		 score.py is score calculating function based on the calculate method provided by official to calculate the score of this model. 

### [Training model]： 
		 models use update in "Realease"

## ------[File Note]------- 
	Due to the license agreement signed with official, so i won't update either training datasets or testing datasets.
